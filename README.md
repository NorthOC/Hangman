# Hangman!

Hi! This is the game where you have a certain amount of guesses to guess a word. The word is picked from a file (selecting a random word out of thousands). Also, I implemented saving and loading mechanics (serialization) with YAML (similar to JSON) which means that you can save your game state and come back to it later!
